All calculations are done on the fly and then stored into the car_owners table, all major functions work as intended. The 
history table appears much lower on the screen than intended. The math operations make use of integers rather than floats by 
design as we felt with numbers this high pennys were meaningless. There is no email field it has instead been replaced by username
however that is not currently reflected in the database as the field storing the username is the email field, there is no username
field in the database.
